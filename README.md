### Document Processing

**Chunking Strategy:**
- Default chunk size: 1000 characters
- Overlap: 200 characters
- Smart boundary detection (sentence endings)
- Metadata preservation (source, position, timestamp)

**Embedding Generation:**
- Model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384-dimensional)
- Batch processing for efficiency
- Persistent storage in ChromaDB

### Hybrid Search

Combines two retrieval methods:
1. **Semantic Search (70%):** Vector similarity matching
2. **Keyword Search (30%):** Term overlap scoring

This handles both conceptual queries and specific terminology.

## 📊 Key Features Explained

### 1. Vector Embeddings
Documents are converted into high-dimensional vectors that capture semantic meaning. Similar concepts have similar vectors, enabling intelligent retrieval.

### 2. Semantic Search
Unlike keyword search, semantic search understands meaning:
- "How do I reduce costs?" matches "cost-cutting strategies"
- "ML algorithms" matches "machine learning techniques"

### 3. Context Window Management
The system intelligently manages context:
- Retrieves relevant chunks
- Maintains conversation history
- Stays within Claude's token limits

### 4. Source Attribution
Every answer includes:
- Source document name
- Relevance score (0-1)
- Text preview
- Chunk position

### 5. Conversational Memory
The system remembers previous exchanges:
- Follow-up questions work naturally
- References to "it" or "that" understood
- Context builds over conversation

    chunk_overlap=300    # More overlap for better continuity
)
```

# In vector_store.py
self.embedding_model = SentenceTransformer('all-mpnet-base-v2')  # Higher quality
```

### Modify Claude Parameters
```python
# In rag_engine.py
response = self.client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    max_tokens=2000,     # Longer answers
    temperature=0.3,     # More focused responses
    system=system_prompt,
    messages=messages
)
```

## 📈 Performance Optimization

**For Large Document Sets:**
1. Use batch embedding generation
2. Implement pagination for retrieval
3. Add embedding cache
4. Use approximate nearest neighbor search

**For Production:**
1. Add Redis for session management
2. Use PostgreSQL for metadata
3. Implement rate limiting
4. Add authentication
5. Deploy with Gunicorn/NGINX

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Local Development
Already configured! Just run `python app.py`

### Docker
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

### Cloud Platforms
- **Heroku:** Add `Procfile` with `web: gunicorn app:app`
- **AWS:** Deploy on ECS with persistent volume for vector_db
- **Google Cloud:** Use Cloud Run with Cloud Storage

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### API Key Required
- Demo mode works without API key (shows retrieval only)
- Full functionality requires Anthropic API key
- Free tier includes generous credits

### Document Privacy
- Documents stored locally in `uploads/` folder
- Vector embeddings stored in `vector_db/` directory
- No data sent to external services except Claude API queries

### Limitations
- Max file size: 10MB (configurable)
- Max document length: Limited by memory
- API rate limits apply (varies by tier)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No API key found"
**Solution:** Create `.env` file and add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key`

### Slow embedding generation
**Normal:** First-time model download takes ~500MB
**Solution:** Model caches after first run

### "CUDA not available" warning
**Normal:** CPU inference works fine for this model
**Optional:** Install torch with CUDA for GPU acceleration

### ChromaDB errors
**Solution:** Delete `vector_db/` folder and restart

## 📝 Interview Preparation

### Expected Questions

**Q: Why use RAG instead of fine-tuning?**
A: RAG is more efficient for knowledge that changes frequently. It's cost-effective, provides source transparency, and doesn't require expensive retraining.

**Q: How do you prevent hallucinations?**
A: By grounding responses in retrieved context, using specific prompts that require citations, and implementing relevance thresholds.

**Q: What's the embedding model architecture?**
A: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 is a sentence transformer based on BERT, producing 384-dimensional dense vectors optimized for semantic similarity.

**Q: How do you handle long documents?**
A: Smart chunking with overlap, hierarchical summarization for very long docs, and top-K retrieval to stay within context limits.

**Q: Why hybrid search?**
A: Combines semantic understanding with precision keyword matching. Semantic search handles concepts, keywords handle specific terms/names.
